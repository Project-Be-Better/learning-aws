# Learning Guide: AWS Microservices Deployment

Welcome to your comprehensive AWS learning journey! This guide will take you through a structured path from local development to production AWS deployment.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Microservices Architecture**: Design patterns and inter-service communication
- **Containerization**: Docker fundamentals and best practices
- **AWS Infrastructure**: VPC, EC2, ECS, RDS, Load Balancers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring & Security**: CloudWatch, security groups, and best practices

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions
- ✅ **Node.js 18+** installed
- ✅ **Docker & Docker Compose** installed
- ✅ **Git** configured
- ✅ **VS Code** or your preferred IDE
- ✅ **AWS CLI** installed and configured

## 🚀 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Local Development (Day 1-2)

#### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd learning-aws

# Run setup script (Windows)
setup.bat

# Or setup script (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### Step 2: Understand the Services

1. **API Gateway** (`services/api-gateway/`):

   - Acts as the entry point
   - Routes requests to other services
   - Handles CORS and common middleware

2. **User Service** (`services/user-service/`):

   - Manages user authentication
   - JWT token handling
   - User CRUD operations

3. **Product Service** (`services/product-service/`):
   - Product catalog management
   - Search and filtering
   - Inventory tracking

#### Step 3: Local Testing

```bash
# Start all services with Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
```

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 1**:

- Modify the API Gateway to add request logging
- Add a new endpoint to the Product Service
- Test inter-service communication

### Phase 2: Containerization Deep Dive (Day 3-4)

#### Step 4: Docker Fundamentals

Study the Dockerfile in each service:

- Multi-stage builds
- Security best practices (non-root users)
- Health checks
- Layer optimization

#### Step 5: Docker Compose Orchestration

Examine `docker-compose.yml`:

- Service dependencies
- Network configuration
- Volume mounts
- Environment variables

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 2**:

- Add a new microservice (e.g., Order Service)
- Configure it in Docker Compose
- Update the API Gateway to route to it

### Phase 3: AWS Infrastructure Basics (Day 5-7)

#### Step 6: AWS Account Setup

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Test access
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

#### Step 7: Terraform Fundamentals

Study the Terraform files:

- `main.tf`: Provider configuration
- `variables.tf`: Input parameters
- `vpc.tf`: Network infrastructure
- `security-groups.tf`: Security configuration
- `load-balancer.tf`: Traffic distribution

#### Step 8: Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Apply infrastructure (start small)
terraform apply
```

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 3**:

- Deploy a minimal VPC with public subnets
- Add a security group for your application
- Create an Application Load Balancer

### Phase 4: Application Deployment (Day 8-10)

#### Step 9: Container Registry (ECR)

```bash
# Create ECR repositories
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name learning-aws-api-gateway
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name learning-aws-user-service
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name learning-aws-product-service

# Build and push images
docker build -t learning-aws-api-gateway services/api-gateway/
docker tag learning-aws-api-gateway:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/learning-aws-api-gateway:latest
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/learning-aws-api-gateway:latest
```

#### Step 10: Container Orchestration (ECS)

Deploy your containers using:

- ECS Fargate for serverless containers
- Or EC2 instances with ECS agent

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 4**:

- Deploy one service to ECS
- Configure health checks
- Set up auto-scaling

### Phase 5: Database & Persistence (Day 11-12)

#### Step 11: RDS Setup

- Create PostgreSQL RDS instance
- Configure security groups
- Update services to use RDS

#### Step 12: Caching Layer

- Set up ElastiCache Redis
- Implement caching in services
- Configure session storage

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 5**:

- Replace in-memory storage with RDS
- Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement database migrations

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline (Day 13-14)

#### Step 13: GitHub Actions Setup

Study the workflow files:

- `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`: Infrastructure pipeline
- `.github/workflows/microservices.yml`: Application pipeline

#### Step 14: Secrets Management

```bash
# Add GitHub secrets
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

#### 📚 **Learning Exercise 6**:

- Set up automated testing
